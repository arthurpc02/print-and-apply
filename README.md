# Linear Print&Apply with ESP32
The P&A is a machine that applies labels using a linear moving arm. There is an integration with a SATO printer to print the labels, then the firmware controls the motion of the arm. The motion uses a stepper motor attached to a rack and pinion system and some sensors.

The hardware is an ESP32 mounted in a PCB designed by me. The PCB interfaces ESP32 with industrial sensors (24V) and other peripherals.
